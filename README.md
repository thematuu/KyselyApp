# KyselyApp
KyselyApp is a survey application developed in Android Studio. The application supports two types of surveys: a multiple-choice survey with emoji responses and a written response survey. The questions for both surveys are fetched from a local database, and the responses are saved in the same database.
## Features
* Two types of surveys: Multiple choice (with emoji responses) and written response.
* Admin page for viewing and managing survey responses and questions.
* Option to save survey responses to the download folder as a CSV file using FileWriter.
* TextToSpeech functionality for questions in the first survey.
* Backup export and import on the admin page.
* All data is saved locally.
## Installation
1. Download the APK release from the Releases.
2. Install the APK on your Android device.
## Usage
1. On the main page, you can navigate to Survey1, Survey2, or the admin page login.

## Localization
The app is in Finnish, but the code and comments are in English. All text in the app is in strings.xml, making it easy to create an English version.
